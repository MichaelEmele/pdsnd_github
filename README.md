### Project Title
Explore US Bikeshare Data

### Description
The project aims at giving the user the possibility to explore bikeshare data from the the following cities: New York City, Washington and Chicago.
It interacts actively with the user asking him at which city he wants to have a look at, at which time. After having asked the user for its input it provides him with statistical information about users, trips, travel times and duration. As a final question the user is asked whether he wants to have a look at some raw data.
